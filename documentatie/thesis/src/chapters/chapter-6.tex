As can be seen in the results, in order to optimize the engine we need to move workload off the CPU and onto the GPU, but with the current WebGL API this is not yet possible. There are ways to do this by generating programmatic graphics that will be generated entirely on the GPU in fragment shaders. 
As future work, it will be interesting to try different deferred rendering techniques and see which one runs the best in WebGL. The difference between WebGL and OpenGL ES would be that desktop computers running WebGL have the bandwidth in order to try more expensive techniques and lack the compute power to make tens of thousands of OpenGL calls as mobile devices can do. 

In all, WebGL opens up new frontiers for gaming on the web and also offers new challenges to design new rendering algorithms that overcome other unique problems.
